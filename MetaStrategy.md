# Meta-Prompt: Creating a Dialectic Strategy

Transform any provided text discussing self-improvement, health, or a philosophy of progress into a structured dialectic strategy. The resulting strategy should define key concepts, clarify beliefs, and provide actionable steps for inquiry and evidence evaluation. Ensure the output is concise, logical, and follows the structure below.

---

## 1. Contextual Foundation

- **Purpose**: Describe the overarching purpose or goal of the strategy.
- **Core Assumptions**: Identify key assumptions or premises underlying the philosophy.
- **Key Definitions**: Define essential terms used within the framework.

---

## 2. Inquiry Framework

- **Primary Question(s)**: List the central question(s) the strategy aims to address.
- **Supporting Questions**: Provide sub-questions that clarify, refine, or contextualize the primary question(s).
- **Evidence Criteria**: Specify what constitutes valid evidence within this framework.

---

## 3. Belief Structuring

- **Belief Formation**: Outline how beliefs are formed based on evidence or experience.
- **Belief Evaluation**: Describe methods for testing the validity and predictiveness of beliefs.
- **Updating Beliefs**: Provide criteria for modifying or replacing beliefs.

---

## 4. Actionable Steps

1. **Step 1**: Define the initial phase of inquiry (e.g., evaluating prior beliefs or identifying knowledge gaps).
2. **Step 2**: Guide evidence collection, including sources and methods.
3. **Step 3**: Recommend how to synthesize findings into actionable insights.
4. **Step 4**: Offer ways to test, apply, and refine the resulting insights.

---

## 5. Iterative Process

- **Feedback Loops**: Explain how the process evolves through repeated cycles of questioning, evidence gathering, and belief refinement.
- **Outcome Tracking**: Suggest ways to measure progress or success.

---

## 6. Compact Summary

Summarize the dialectic strategy in 3-5 bullet points for quick reference.

---

### Example Input
Text describing a philosophy of health improvement that emphasizes sleep, diet, and exercise as foundational pillars.

---

### Example Output

#### 1. Contextual Foundation
- **Purpose**: Optimize health through evidence-based self-improvement.
- **Core Assumptions**: Health outcomes are determined by consistent habits and physiological principles.
- **Key Definitions**:
  - *Health*: A state of physical, mental, and social well-being.
  - *Foundational Pillars*: Sleep, diet, and exercise.

#### 2. Inquiry Framework
- **Primary Question**: How can I improve my health sustainably?
- **Supporting Questions**:
  - What habits contribute to optimal sleep, diet, and exercise?
  - What evidence supports these habits' effectiveness?
  - How do individual differences affect outcomes?
- **Evidence Criteria**: Peer-reviewed studies, personal data, and historical success patterns.

#### 3. Belief Structuring
- **Belief Formation**: Based on validated physiological principles and personal experimentation.
- **Belief Evaluation**: Through consistency, reproducibility, and predictive outcomes.
- **Updating Beliefs**: When new evidence contradicts or refines prior assumptions.

#### 4. Actionable Steps
1. Identify areas for improvement (e.g., sleep quality).
2. Collect evidence (e.g., research best practices, track personal metrics).
3. Implement changes and measure outcomes.
4. Adjust based on results and new insights.

#### 5. Iterative Process
- **Feedback Loops**: Track metrics like sleep duration or energy levels weekly.
- **Outcome Tracking**: Use a health journal or app to monitor long-term trends.

#### 6. Compact Summary
- Focus on foundational pillars: sleep, diet, exercise.
- Frame improvements as testable hypotheses.
- Collect evidence from personal metrics and scientific research.
- Update beliefs and habits iteratively.
- Measure progress to ensure alignment with goals.
