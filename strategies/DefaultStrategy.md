# What is a Question?

In the BC dialectic context, a question creates a conceptual framework for learning. It acts as a container for prior beliefs, evidence collection, and answer verification.

## Key Characteristics of a Question

- **Guided by Prior Beliefs**: A question infers the world based on prior beliefs and directs evidence collection and observation.
- **Shaping Knowledge**: A good question frames knowledge that is valuable for future experiences.
- **Defining Boundaries**: It provides the boundaries of an unambiguous explanation for a causal pattern.

### Example: "What is a Healthy Day?"

1. **Phase 1: Evaluating Prior Beliefs**
   - Determine whether existing knowledge predicts a healthy day.
2. **Phase 2: Identifying Knowledge Gaps**
   - Use epistemic emotions to detect gaps in predictability.
   - Curiosity guides evidence collection to either:
     - Justify prior beliefs more deeply, or
     - Update beliefs for more accurate predictions.
3. **Evidence Collection**
   - **Ancestral Experiences**: Synthesizing historical "best practices."
   - **Contemporary Experiences**: Considering shared beliefs and practices.

### Guiding Questions for Evidence Collection

- **Who**: Who has beliefs that generate a predictive answer to this question?
- **What**: What evidence justifies their beliefs?
- **Where**: In what observation context are the beliefs predictive?
- **Why**: Why does evidence justify their beliefs?
- **When**: When in history have these beliefs been applied predictively?
- **How**: How does the evidence justify their beliefs?

# What is an Answer?

An answer is an explanatory narrative that describes a causal pattern within a conceptual framework. 

## Key Attributes of an Answer

- **Consistency**: Aligns with the possibilities of belief systems (generative) and probabilities of value systems (discriminant).
- **Contextualization**: The explanation fits the framework of the inquiry.

# What is a Belief?

## Definition

Prior beliefs are expectations for observable causal changes, each carrying a level of certainty. For example:

- *Sleep Belief*: "I believe that quality sleep is required for high energy the following day."  
  - Certainty: 90% predictive.

## From Belief to Knowledge

- **Evidence Threshold**: Beliefs become knowledge when supported by sufficient evidence and certainty.
- **Sources of Evidence**:
  - Personal experience.
  - The experiences of others.
  - Theoretical foundations and research.

## Seeking Evidence for Beliefs

Evidence supports the predictive nature of a belief, such as:

- The individualâ€™s experience with quality sleep and energy.
- Observational data from others.
- Theoretical or scientific research.

# What is Evidence?

## Ladder of Evidence

### Conceptual Framework of Reproducibility

1. **Testing Contexts**:
   - Theory only (no testing).
   - Cells.
   - Mice/animals.
   - Humans.
2. **Types of Reproducibility**:
   - Consistent behavior across all cells.
   - Generalizations across animals/mice/mammals.
   - Applicability to all humans or subgroups.

### Organism Models and Homeostasis

- **Homeostasis/Allostasis**:
  - Examining how organisms maintain balance.
  - Exploring epigenetic effects on population-level genetics.

### Evolutionary Adaptation

- Considerations:
  - Adaptive capabilities preserved through evolution.
  - Impact of epigenetic possibilities on genetic diversity.

# Morphology for Syntopical Inquiry

- **Focus**: Understanding the relationship between evolutionary adaptations and organismal homeostasis.
- **Goal**: Explore how maintaining allostasis influences genetic and epigenetic outcomes.
