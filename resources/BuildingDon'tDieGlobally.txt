What is Don’t Die
We are evolving into something new. 
We believe in an extraordinary future; beyond our ability to imagine. 
We fight for the freedom to exist as long as one chooses. 
We are at war with death and its causes. 
Why? Because we have things to do tomorrow. 
Why join DD
Conflict is everywhere now, and people focus primarily on their differences. DD is a universal message that unites our shared humanity. 

Our culture has made people increasingly isolated, due to our technology, politics, and economy. DD will break away from that to bring people together in a community that exists both globally / virtually and locally / in-person. 

DD is the most widely played game in history, but we don't talk about it. By embracing DD as our mission, we can make tangible our enjoyment of the process of discovery, the sport of pursuing our goals, and the fun of living our lives to the fullest.

What is the DD Community 
We are a community that is united in prioritizing health and wellness. We rebel against Die culture such as smoking, alcohol, junk food, environmental toxins, digital addictions, sleep deprivation, violence and other similar things that shorten life and lessen health and vitality. We are united in defeating all causes of human and planetary death and building all promoters of prosperity. 
DD Principles 

A DD citizen is careful in thought, eager to learn, forgiving of others, kind and compassionate, and relentless in deed. 

We hold that:  
Existence is the highest virtue. 
Death is our only foe. 
Be as you wish to become. 
Do as you want done to you. 
Not knowing is intelligence. 

Don’t die individually.
Don’t kill each other. 
Don’t destroy the planet. 
Align AI with Don’t die.

DD Code of Conduct 

DD Citizens will: 
take care of one another. 
put community first, and 
not be a jerk, lie, cheat or steal. 

Don’t Die Organization 
Global leadership - Bryan Johnson 


Regional leaders are responsible for overseeing large geographic regions (e.g., North America, Europe, Asia), building partnerships, recruiting DD leaders, supervising national leaders and reporting to Bryan. They implement initiatives, adapt the DD philosophy to local cultures, and coordinate global events and initiatives within their regions. 

Country leaders report to regional leaders and are responsible for national communities. They build partnerships, recruit DD leaders, provide cultural localization, coordinate national events, and act as the face of DD within their country. 

State/Province leadership reports to country leaders and manage smaller regional units, overseeing the activities of multiple cities within their jurisdiction. They build partnerships, recruit DD leaders, facilitate the sharing of resources and communication between cities, assist in event planning, and support the local leadership of Community Managers.

Community Leadership reports to state/province leadership and oversee communities within specific cities. They’re responsible for city-level events, managing finances for city-specific needs, and supporting Chapter Hosts. They also help manage and grow local chapters by connecting with people based on shared interests.

Chapter Hosts report to community leadership and run individual chapters within cities, hosting regular events and managing engagement within their group. They’re selected based on commitment and alignment with “Don’t Die” values and the feedback from DD members. Chapters could vary by focus (fitness, mental health, nutrition) to allow members to join a group that aligns with their interests.
Chapter leadership roles (initially, the Chapter Host complets all of these functions): 
Chapter Co-Hosts are hosts-in-training, assisting with running events and maintaining engagement. They help with member retention, providing more personalized support within each chapter.
Event Coordinator: Plans and manages logistics for all chapter events, including monthly gatherings, workshops, and special activities, ensuring everything runs smoothly.
Membership Coordinator: Welcomes new members, helps them understand the DD philosophy, answers questions, and connects them with resources or people within the chapter.
Health and Wellness Lead: Coordinates meals and food for events, organizes sessions on fitness, nutrition, mental health, or other wellness areas aligned with the DD mission.
Outreach and Recruitment Lead: Handles local outreach, recruits new members, and collaborates on strategies to increase the chapter’s visibility in the community.
Content Creator: Manages social media, photography, and content for the chapter, capturing events and member stories to share online and within the community.
Finance Officer: Manages chapter funds, tracks donations, budgets for events, and ensures financial transparency. Coordinates with the Community Manager if financial support is needed.
Education Coordinator: Organizes educational sessions, invites guest speakers, or curates resources on health, longevity, and related DD topics for the chapter.
Gamification & Challenge Coordinator: Runs monthly or quarterly challenges, maintains member leaderboards, and promotes healthy competition to keep members engaged and motivated.
Volunteer Coordinator: Manages and supports volunteers for events and chapter activities, ensuring members who want to help have clear roles and responsibilities.
Partner Liaison: Establishes and maintains relationships with local businesses, health providers, or wellness centers that align with DD seeking discounts or partnerships.
Youth Program Leader: Organizes activities specifically for younger members or families, including youth-friendly events, workshops, and educational sessions on health and wellness.
These roles can be adjusted based on chapter size and needs, and some members may take on multiple roles if needed. By distributing responsibilities, chapters can stay organized, grow steadily, and provide a meaningful experience for members.

Individual Members join chapters based on their interests. They participate in local, regional, national and global events. Members are given roles to help organize events, welcome newcomers, or lead small groups within a chapter, reinforcing the community and their connection to the movement.

Volunteer Coordinators are local members who take on roles within the local community. 

Leadership Development Program: Regional, city, and chapter leaders attend training to understand the DD philosophy deeply and learn how to communicate the principles effectively. This includes online courses, mentorship, and regular leadership retreats to maintain alignment with global goals.

Member Onboarding and Education: New members receive structured materials to learn the basics of DD. This includes philosophy, principles, endeavors, and event guidelines. Onboarding programs could be run by local leaders or volunteers.

Global events are streamed to all members. These events unite the community, introduce new themes, and showcase speakers. Local chapters then hold follow-up meetings to discuss the quarterly focus.

Build a DD Vertical 
For some DD is about personal health and longevity. For others it’s about how we raise children, maintain a healthy planet, build safe AI, create government policy and address mental health, to name a few. 

Create your own specialized DD vertical with the following steps: 

Step 1: Identify the source of death 
+ Biological aging which leads to death 

Step 2. State your goal
+ Personally achieve age escape velocity where one year passes and I remain the same biological age. 

Step 3: Create a plan 
+ Measure every organ of my body to determine its biological age; 
+ Consult the best science;
+ Implement the power law therapies; 
+ Reframe “normal” of self destructive behaviors to its reality, violence against self 
+ Continuously measure organs to evaluate age slowing or age reversal effect; 
+ Repeat until the goal is achieved.  

Step 4: Measure and keep score because progress begins with counting. 

You can build your own DD effort
Step 1: Identify the source of death
Step 2. State your goal 
Step 3: Create a plan 
Step 4: Build technology/community/coalition and scale 

“I have so many questions”. Us too. 

DD means something different to everyone. It’s also complicated, nuanced and sometimes hard to quantify. For example, is staying out late with friends better than going to bed on time? How about just once a month?  Is accelerating technological development better than slowing it down? Does sometimes eating a treat make any meaningful difference? 

There are thousands of more great questions on what DD means practically, politically, economically, philosophically. That’s ok. We work on these gnarly problems all the time in society. For example, Democracy is just over 200 years old. A general consensus emerged in the 1770s that citizens wanted to adopt democracy in place of monarchy. We’ve spent the past two centuries fighting about what that actually means. DD is no different. There are endless questions to ask and answer. 

What’s important is that there are enough of us to create a general consensus that after 4.5 billion years, for the first time ever, we can be bold in imagining that continued life is a choice.
